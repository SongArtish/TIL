## Overview

```
a document that demonstrates the relationship between requirements and other artifacts.
```

- to prove that requirements have been fulfilled
- typically documents requirements, tests, test results, and issues



## Traceability

```
Requirements traceability is the ability to connect requirements to other artifacts — such as different types of software tests or bugs. It's used to track requirements — and prove that requirements have been fulfilled. 
```

### Bidirectional Traceability

- the ability to trace forward (e.g., from requirement to test case) and backward (e.g., from test case to requirement).
- It establishes a relationship between two artifacts.
