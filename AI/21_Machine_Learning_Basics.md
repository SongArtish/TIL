## Definition

- Limitations of explicit programming.

```markdown
"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" Arthur Samuel (1959)
```



## Learning

### Supervised Learning

- learning with labeled examples (`Training Data Set`)

- most common problem type in <u>ML</u>

- examples

  ```markdown
  Image labeling: learning from tagged images
  Email spam filter: learning from labeled email
  Predicting exam score: learning from previous exam score and time spent
  ```

  |                      Case                       |             Method             |
  | :---------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
  | Predicting final exam score based on time spent |         **regression**         |
  |        Pass/non-pass based on time spent        |   **binary classification**    |
  |        Letter grade based on time spent         | **multi-label classification** |

### Unsupervised Learning

- un-labeled date
- ex. Google news grouping, Word clustering



## Regression
