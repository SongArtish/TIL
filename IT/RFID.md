## Outline

- RFID is not a communications technology; rather, it's designed for identification.
- RFID tags can hold a small amount of data

### 1) Passive RFID

- The radio signal from a passive RFID reader reaches a tag, the tag absorbs the energy and reflects back its identity.

### 2) Active RFID

- The receiver has its own power source and can therefore generate its own radio signal rather than relying on the energy it absorbs from the sender.
