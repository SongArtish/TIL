Browser security is the application of Internet security to web browsers in order to protect networked data and computer systems from breaches of privacy or malware. 

### CORS

CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system, consisting of transmitting [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_header), that determines whether browsers block frontend JavaScript code from accessing responses for cross-origin requests.

The [same-origin security policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) forbids cross-origin access to resources. But CORS gives web servers the ability to say they want to opt into allowing cross-origin access to their resources.
